For a demo that doesn't require users to set up a local environment, you can host the app on a free or low-effort platform. Here are some options:

1. **GitHub Pages (Static Sites Only)**:

   - If your Flask app doesnâ€™t require server-side interactivity, consider converting it to a static site (e.g., using Flask-Frozen) and hosting on GitHub Pages.

2. **Glitch or Replit**:

   - Platforms like [Replit](https://replit.com/) or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) allow you to run Python-based web apps with zero local setup.
   - Upload your project, and they'll provide a live link.

3. **Render or Heroku**:
   - [Render](https://render.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) offer free tiers for hosting small apps.
   - This is slightly more complex but results in a live site you can share with others.
